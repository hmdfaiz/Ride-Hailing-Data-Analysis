# Ride Hailing Data Analysis

This is my first case for my data analytic experience. I did this analysis on Google Colab with Python library such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Deployment

To deploy this project,

```bash
  1. Download the Uber Drives - 2016.csv file
  2. Make sure you have Google Colaboratory account
  3. If you do, then open a new notebook
  4. Connect to the server
  5. Upload the file that u just downloaded
  6. Copy the file path
  6. Store it to a new data frame
  7. Go to my Ride-Hailing Data Analysis.ipynb
  8. Copy one by one the line of code and can see the result
```

## Objective

Our analysis objective:
 - Data Cleaning
 - Check every date/time data type (ensure them in proper data type)
 - Extract the hour, day, week and month from "START_DATE*" column
 - Check and plot the categories
